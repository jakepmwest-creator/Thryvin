"I need to improve the AI integration on my Thryvin’ fitness app to make workouts dynamic, relevant, and personalized based on the user. This should include a custom experience for first-time users and smarter workout generation every time.

🔐 1. Link AI to Login/User Profile
Use the existing login system to retrieve each user’s data:

username

fitness goal

experience level

preferred training days

equipment access

any injuries or movement limits

Store this in a global userProfile object once logged in

The AI should use this profile every time it generates a workout

✨ 2. First-Time User Personalization Flow
Detect if this is the user's first time accessing the workout system

If yes: show a custom onboarding modal or full-screen intro titled:

“Let’s Build Your Personalized Fitness Plan 💡”

Ask these deeper, AI-specific questions:

What’s your top fitness goal right now?

What time of day do you normally train?

How do you feel about cardio?

Do you have any areas you want to avoid or focus on?

How many minutes per session do you want to spend training?

Save these answers to the userProfile and let the AI use them for all future decisions

Only show this once, or when the user resets their plan

🧠 3. Smart Workout Generation
When generating a daily workout (e.g. “Upper Body - Back”):

Only include relevant exercises (e.g. rows, pull-ups)

Rotate muscle groups across the week based on their preferences

Scale difficulty with user experience

Factor in any injuries and time preference

Don’t repeat exact workouts every day — add intelligent variation

Make the generation modular so it can be reused on weekly plan creation, or on daily re-rolls

🗓️ 4. Schedule Integration
Use the user’s preferred training days to populate the weekly view

Attach muscle group targets to each day

Ensure the calendar view reflects this schedule and lets users click in to view/edit

🛠️ Dev Notes
You can simulate AI logic in JavaScript or link to an OpenAI function if available

Keep all logic modular and consistent with the Thryvin’ app style and voice

Make sure onboarding only appears once, and that returning users skip straight to their calendar and daily plan"
