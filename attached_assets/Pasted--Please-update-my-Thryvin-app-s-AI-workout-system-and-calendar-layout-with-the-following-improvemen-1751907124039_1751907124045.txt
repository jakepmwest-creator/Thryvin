"Please update my Thryvin‚Äô app's AI workout system and calendar layout with the following improvements to increase personalization and user experience.

‚ú® 1. First-Time AI Personalization Flow (Free Text Input)
When a user logs in for the first time:

Trigger a one-time onboarding prompt or modal that asks a series of personal questions

Use free-text input (or speech-to-text) instead of multiple choice

Example questions:

What's your #1 fitness goal right now?

What time of day do you prefer to train?

How many days per week are realistic for you?

Any injuries or movements you avoid?

What motivates you most ‚Äî progress, fun, challenge, or something else?

Store each response to a userProfile object

This profile should inform all future workouts the AI generates

Don‚Äôt show this again unless user resets preferences

üß† 2. Fix Workout Plan Generation
Currently, clicking on any workout day or type (e.g. HIIT, Lower Body) shows the same "Upper Body" workout

Please update the logic so the workout type selected or assigned to the calendar actually affects the generated workout:

e.g. if it‚Äôs a "HIIT" day, show cardio-based interval training

if it‚Äôs ‚ÄúLower Body‚Äù, only include leg and glute exercises

Map muscle group focus to each scheduled day using userSchedule

Use userProfile + day type + goal + past performance to generate a diverse workout

üìÜ 3. Monthly Calendar UI Fix
Redesign the monthly view layout to match the rest of the Thryvin‚Äô aesthetic (modern, gradient, spaced, smooth)

Fix spacing:

Add more padding and breathing room around each day square

Make the layout responsive and mobile-friendly

Visual cues:

Dim or grey-out past days

Highlight the current day

Use a subtle glow or ring on upcoming days with scheduled workouts

‚úÖ Add a checkmark or badge for completed workouts

Functionality:

Clicking a date should open a modal or drawer to view/edit the workout plan for that day

Allow the user to shift the workout to another date

Add a small "+" button on calendar view to add new training sessions manually

üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes
Keep all UI consistent with the purple/pink Thryvin' color scheme

Make sure the AI logic actually pulls the right exercises for the right days

Make the new calendar layout reusable for the stats view in the future"
