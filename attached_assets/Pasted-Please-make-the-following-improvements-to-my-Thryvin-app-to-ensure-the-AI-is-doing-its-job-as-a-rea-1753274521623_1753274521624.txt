Please make the following improvements to my Thryvin‚Äô app to ensure the AI is doing its job as a real fitness coach, and to fix key parts of the workout calendar logic.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Questionnaire Answers to Generate Personalized Workouts
When a new user completes the pre-workout questionnaire (not the main onboarding), the app currently collects:

Fitness goal

Time of day they prefer to train

Days available to train

Workout duration preference

Equipment access

Experience level

Any injuries

These answers must be stored in a persistent object like userWorkoutProfile, saved to localStorage or backend

Update the AI workout generation function to actively use these values when building workouts:

Example:

If the goal is fat loss ‚Üí prioritize cardio or HIIT styles

If the user has no equipment ‚Üí use only bodyweight exercises

If training duration = 30 mins ‚Üí limit total sets/time

If the user has shoulder injuries ‚Üí avoid overhead pressing, push-ups

Make sure the generated plan reflects this data every time it's shown

Don‚Äôt default to a generic plan ‚Äî adapt based on these fields

2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Weekly Calendar Click-to-Workout Flow
The weekly calendar view used to allow users to click a specific day and view/edit that day‚Äôs workout

That feature is currently broken or missing ‚Äî please bring it back

Clicking a day should open a drawer/modal or navigate to that day‚Äôs workout

Include options to:

View full workout

Swap an exercise

Mark workout as complete

Leave AI feedback on performance

3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure Monthly Calendar Fully Works
The monthly view should:

Display the full month, responsive and styled like the rest of the app

Highlight today‚Äôs date

Dim past dates

‚úÖ Show completion status for previous workouts

Allow users to tap a day to view or edit the workout

Please double-check that the layout and click-through functionality is fully working and consistent with the weekly view

üîß Developer Notes
Use existing user context or auth to persist the profile data

If user profile changes, regenerate their next workout plan accordingly

Keep styles consistent with the Thryvin‚Äô branding (purple/pink gradient, smooth rounded edges, mobile-first design)
