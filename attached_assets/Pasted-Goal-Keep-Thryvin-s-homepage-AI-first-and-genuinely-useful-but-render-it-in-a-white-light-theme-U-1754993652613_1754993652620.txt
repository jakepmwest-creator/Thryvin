Goal: Keep Thryvin’s homepage AI‑first and genuinely useful, but render it in a white/light theme. Use existing routes and real data. No legacy “Kai” links.

0) Shell
Keep top app bar with Thryvin logo (left) and settings (right → /profile/settings).

Keep bottom nav (Home*, Workouts, Nutrition, Social, Profile).

Vertical scroll only (the only horizontal scroll is the Activity swipe deck).

1) AI Talking Banner (light theme)
Full‑width hero just under the app bar.

Subtle light gradient background (white → #F6F7FB with a faint brand tint).

Copy:

Title: “Hey, {firstName} 👋”

Subtext: AI daily line (time/day/context aware), e.g. “Upper body push today—want me to tweak it?”

Small animated voice‑wave icon on the right (gentle pulse).

Tap → open the existing AI Coach (same endpoint as your coach button):
/coach?thread=new&prefill=Tell%20me%20about%20today

2) “Today” Progress Row
Three compact rings with labels underneath:

Workouts → /workouts?date=today

Nutrition → /nutrition?date=today

Recovery → /recovery

Light theme style: neutral track on white, brand‑accent progress.

Animate stroke + count‑up on mount (600–800ms).

3) Main Content Cards (stacked, airy, not boxed)
A) Today’s Workout

Shows workout name (e.g., Upper Body Push), duration, quick tags.

Primary button: Start → /workouts/player?date=today

Text link: View week → /workouts?view=week

Entire card tap → /workouts?date=today

B) Activity — Swipe Deck (the only horizontal scroll)
Include these mini‑cards (soft light gradients / tinted fills):

Nutrition — “Complete 3 healthy meals” + mini progress → /nutrition?date=today

Recovery — “Log your relaxation” → /recovery

Stats Snapshot — e.g., “Workouts this week: 2/5” → /stats

Social Highlight — e.g., “Alex hit a PB today” → /social?view=trending

Coach Tip — bite‑sized AI advice → /coach?prefill=Coach%20tip%20for%20today

Challenge — “3‑Day Core Challenge” → your route (e.g., /stats?view=challenges)

Smooth snap‑center; 16px card gap; gentle elevation.

C) Today’s Meals (Preview)

Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner one‑liners for today.

Button: View meals → /nutrition?date=today

Secondary: Swap ideas → /coach?prefill=Suggest%20meal%20alternatives%20for%20today

D) Awards Teaser

“You’re 1 workout away from your next badge.”

Button → /awards

E) Social Highlights

1–2 clean tiles previewing posts/trending.

Tap → /social (or /social?view=trending)

4) Behaviour & Data
Use real data for rings and cards (no placeholders).

Do not re‑run onboarding if profile.hasPlan === true.

All deep links route to your existing pages above.

Remove any legacy references to “Kai”; use your current coach chat only.

5) Light Theme Tokens (examples)
Background: #FFFFFF

Section bg: #FFFFFF with soft shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.06) 0 8px 24px

Text primary: #0B0F1A; secondary: #6B7280

Brand gradient (accents/buttons): linear-gradient(135deg,#7A3CF3 0%,#FF4FD8 100%)

Rings: track #EDF0F5; progress = brand accent

Corners: 20dp main; 12–14dp minis

Spacing: 16–24px gutters; 12–16px inside cards

6) QA checklist
Banner tap → opens existing coach chat (not a placeholder).

Each ring navigates correctly to its tab.

Carousel swipes smoothly; routes per card are correct.

Start on Today’s Workout opens the player for today.

No horizontal page scroll outside the Activity deck.

No duplicate headings; top bar + bottom nav present.
