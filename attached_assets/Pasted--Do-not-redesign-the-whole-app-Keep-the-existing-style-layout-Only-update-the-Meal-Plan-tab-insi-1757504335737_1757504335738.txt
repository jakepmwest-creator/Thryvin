⚠️ Do not redesign the whole app. Keep the existing style/layout. Only update the Meal Plan tab inside Nutrition.

What to do

Calendar (top of screen)

Weekly strip (Mon–Sun) with small dots under each day showing % meals selected.

Click a day → load that day’s meal plan below.

Swipe left/right to move weeks (like workout calendar).

Monthly calendar toggle is fine — just make it work (click day → load plan).

Today’s Nutrition Plan (below calendar)

Use accordions for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack.

Closed = show chosen option.

Open = show 3 AI-picked options (title, kcal, macros).

Each option has buttons: Select · Swap · Customize · Explain.

At bottom of each accordion: Ask AI bar (text input + smart chips like No chicken, Gluten-free, Cheaper).

Functionality

Selecting an option updates that meal and shows Undo snackbar.

Swap with AI returns new options.

Customize lets user swap protein/carb/fat and shows macro preview.

Missing ingredients = “Add to shopping list?” button.

Weekly dots fill based on how many meals selected for that day.

Keep the style

Light theme (bg-slate-50, bg-white cards, border-slate-200, indigo accent).

Rounded-2xl, small shadows, same design as rest of app.

Hide scrollbars but keep scrolling (.scroll-hidden).
