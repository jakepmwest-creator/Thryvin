Goal:
Create a visually detailed and emotionally expressive cloud character using p5.js that serves as the face of an AI personal trainer. The character should feel alive, responsive, and full of personality — blending soft animated aesthetics with subtle realism.

Visual Design:

A grey, fluffy cloud with realistic softness and layering — built from many animated overlapping ellipses for volume and depth.

The cloud should have a gentle bobbing float (vertical sine wave motion) and side-to-side sway (horizontal movement).

Two bright neon blue rectangular eyes, slightly glowing.

Eyes should track the user's mouse using easing (smooth movement).

Blinking animation every few seconds.

Eyes narrow or widen based on mood/emotion.

Emotions / Moods:
The cloud should display expressive emotional states, controlled by variables like:

Happy: Eyes widen, float increases slightly, sparkles around the cloud

Focused: Eyes narrow slightly, sparks pause, cloud movement becomes steadier

Thinking: One eye squints, subtle pulsing of cloud, occasional "?" above head

Tired: Eyes half-closed, cloud sinks slightly, slower bobbing

Excited: Eyes large and bright, small electric sparks appear frequently

Mood changes should be visible and optionally time-triggered or changeable via function calls (to allow future voice/mood logic).

Interactions:

Mouse movement: eyes follow the cursor with easing

Click: triggers a burst of electric spark animations around the cloud

Idle: auto-blink, idle expressions (e.g. thinking or sleepy)

Animation Features:

Use sin() or noise() for cloud bobbing and swaying motion

Electric spark effects:

Fade out over time

Light up edge of cloud subtly

Triggered manually or randomly

Eyes animate with smooth transitions (not rigid or static)

Code Requirements:

Use p5.js, fully compatible with Replit

Modular structure with classes:

Cloud: handles fluff, floating, expression

Eye: handles tracking, blinking, shape changes

Spark: manages animations and lifespan

Lightweight, optimized for real-time web use

Responsive canvas (adjusts to screen size)

Future-Proofing:

Design structure should allow easy future additions:

Text dialogue bubble

Voice interaction or audio playback

Workout-specific moods or motivational responses

UI integration (progress tracking, feedback loops)
