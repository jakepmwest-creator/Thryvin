Goal: Redesign the gamified screen into two sections the user can swipe between (and tap via a segmented control):

AWARDS tab

QUESTS tab
Keep the existing top banner (level + XP) and global nav. Use real data; no placeholders.

0) Shell
Keep top banner as-is (Level N, XP bar, subtle confetti on level‑up).

Under banner: segmented control centered: Awards | Quests.

Swipe left/right switches tabs; tapping the segment animates to that tab.

Light theme; rounded corners (20dp); soft shadows; brand gradients for accents.

1) AWARDS tab (swipe to this)
Layout (top → bottom):

Streaks row (horizontal mini-cards):

Workout Streak, Nutrition Streak, Recovery Streak.

Each shows day count, tiny progress ring, and last completed date.

Tap → opens Stats filtered to that area.

Recent badges (2×N grid, auto-wrap):

Unlocked badges in full colour with a soft shine loop (CSS).

Locked badges greyed with lock icon + tooltip “Do X to unlock”.

Tap any badge → Badge modal:

Large badge art, title, description, XP value, unlock criteria.

If locked: show clear requirement + Track this toggle to pin its tracker to the Home “Activity” deck.

All badges (filter chips):

Filters: All, Consistency, Strength, Mobility, Nutrition, Challenges.

Grid stays in place; filtering animates items (no layout jump).

Behavior:

Unlock event → quick confetti burst over the banner and the badge card.

XP bar increments smoothly; level‑up triggers banner animation.

2) QUESTS tab (swipe to this)
Layout (top → bottom):

Daily quests (horizontal carousel):

3–5 cards, each with gradient background (category colour), title, short requirement, mini progress bar, XP reward.

Buttons: Track (pins to Home Activity), Details.

Completing shows Claim XP chip on the card.

Weekly quests (2‑column grid):

Similar cards with bigger progress bars and larger XP.

Tap → Quest modal:

Requirement breakdown (e.g., “5 workouts this week; 3/5 done”), eligible actions (open Workouts/Nutrition), due date/time left.

Buttons: Abandon (optional), Claim XP (when done).

Monthly/Seasonal challenge (wide card):

Big gradient hero with progress ring, time remaining, reward bundle (XP + badge).

CTA: View leaderboard (optional route), Open details.

Behavior:

Quest progress auto‑updates from core events (workout complete, meals logged, recovery minutes).

Claim XP animates → updates XP bar in banner.

“Track” pins a quest card to Home Activity deck.

3) Navigation & Routes
Badge tap → /awards/badge/:id

Streak tap → /stats?focus=workout|nutrition|recovery

Quest detail → /awards/quests/:id

Track actions add a tile to the Home Activity row (existing pattern).

4) Theme tokens (light)
Page bg #FFFFFF; card bg #FFFFFF with rgba(0,0,0,.06) 0 8px 24px

Text: primary #0B0F1A, secondary #6B7280

Brand gradient: linear-gradient(135deg,#7A3CF3 0%,#FF4FD8 100%)

Category gradients:

Workouts (purple), Nutrition (green), Recovery (blue), Challenges (gold)

Corners: 20dp (cards), 12–14dp (chips)

Motion: 180–220ms ease for tab swipe, grid filter, progress updates

5) Data & State
Levels & XP: single source of truth; awarding XP is idempotent (no double‑claim).

Streaks: derived server‑side (missed day breaks unless “rest day” counted).

Quests: status ∈ {active, completed_unclaimed, claimed}; progress derived from events.

Badge unlocks logged with timestamp; locked badges expose requirement preview.

6) QA checklist
Segmented control + swipe keep content in a single route (no reload).

Claiming XP updates banner instantly and cannot double‑claim.

Filtering badges works without layout jump; locked/unlocked states correct.

Tracking a quest/badge adds a tile to Home Activity.

Confetti/shine animations are performant on mid‑range phones.
