Please revise and streamline the Nutrition tab to be much more clean, intuitive, and easy to use. The content and functionality are good — now it just needs to feel polished, modern, and user-friendly. Follow these refinements:

🧠 OVERVIEW PAGE IMPROVEMENTS
Current Issue: The “Overview” page has sections like Daily Progress, AI Nutrition Coach, Weekly Progress, and Quick Log — but it's cluttered and not visually clean.

Replace with:

📅 Today’s Summary: Show today’s selected meals (from calendar) at a glance

🥦 Nutrient Breakdown: Pie chart showing carbs/fats/proteins from what’s logged today

🧠 Smart AI Tip of the Day: Short, useful advice based on current progress

❤️ Recent Favorites: Horizontal scroll list of 3–4 meals saved recently

🛒 “Build My Shopping List” button linking to auto-generated grocery list

📅 NUTRITION PLANS + CALENDAR
Merge ‘AI Plans’ and ‘My Plans’ into a single “Meal Plan” section

When user taps a day in the calendar, show the plan for that day

Make the calendar weekly/monthly view fully functional and smooth

Keep the new Galaxy-style calendar you added for monthly

When a day has meals planned, display an icon/badge to show it’s filled

Days in the past should dim visually

🍽️ DAILY MEAL LAYOUT (Make It Sleek)
Current Problem: Too much vertical scrolling — it shows all meals at once

Replace with accordion/drop-downs:

Display just “Breakfast,” “Lunch,” “Dinner” (and maybe “Snacks”)

When tapped, each section expands smoothly to show the 2–3 options

Keep the swap, favorite, and log buttons inside each drop-down

Swipe Support:

Allow left/right swipe to switch between days (like Instagram Stories feel)

This works well for viewing yesterday/tomorrow without extra taps

📹 MEAL DETAILS
When a meal is tapped:

Show: Image, ingredients, calorie/macros, video recipe, and cooking steps

Fix the video link issue (currently showing irrelevant videos)

Either embed YouTube or a native player

Swap button must function with alternatives that match dietary preferences

When user clicks “Save to Favorites”, add it to a Favorites tab or carousel on Overview

🛒 SHOPPING LIST (NEW)
From the Overview or a tab:

Tap to auto-generate a grocery list for the upcoming meals

Let users check off items or export the list

Group by category (Protein, Veg, Pantry, etc.)

💡 GENERAL POLISH
Remove duplicate ‘X’ buttons in top-right of modals

Eliminate the ugly blue hover bar color — use theme-appropriate accents

Ensure all elements are clean, spaced well, mobile-responsive, and smooth

Keep everything touch-friendly, light on clutter, and sleek

🔧 Dev Notes:
All styling must remain consistent with the Thryvin’ brand: purple/pink gradients, rounded corners, subtle shadows, smooth transitions

Prioritize a mobile-first design

Aim to reduce scroll fatigue and increase tappable clarity
