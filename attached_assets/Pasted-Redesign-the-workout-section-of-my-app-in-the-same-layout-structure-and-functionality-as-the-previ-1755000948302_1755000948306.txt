Redesign the workout section of my app in the same layout, structure, and functionality as the previous dark theme design I approved, but in a clean, modern light theme.

Theme & Style

Use a bright, clean white/light grey background with subtle, smooth gradients in soft pastel tones for section backgrounds (light blues, greens, and purples) instead of solid dark blocks.

Keep the design minimal but visually engaging, with soft shadows, rounded corners, and good spacing between elements.

Ensure text and icons have high contrast for readability.

Top Section – Calendar

Keep the calendar view as in the dark version, with the ability to toggle between weekly view and monthly view.

When a date is tapped, it should still pull up the workout detail page for that day (exactly as in the current working version).

Ensure the “Swap Workout” option is still available and functional from this detail page.

Today’s Workout Card

At the very top under the calendar, show Today’s Workout as a large, clean card with the workout name, duration, and difficulty.

Include a “Start Workout” button that still links to the current functional workout flow (warm-up → main workout → recovery).

Workout Flow (Warm-up → Main Workout → Recovery)

Preserve all functionality where:

Each section expands to show exercises when tapped.

Each exercise can still be clicked to view its video, description, and logging options.

Buttons for logging performance or skipping exercises still work.

At the end of the workout, still display the “Workout Complete” screen, but in a cleaner style for the light theme.

Explore Section (Bottom)

Keep the explore categories (e.g., Calisthenics, Strength, HIIT) as in the previous design, but styled to match the light theme.

Ensure all category buttons link to the correct existing pages as they currently do.

Functionality Preservation

Do not break any existing working features — especially:

Clicking calendar dates.

Viewing workout details.

Starting and completing workouts.

Swap workout functionality.

Viewing exercise videos and logging performance.

Animations & Transitions

Keep smooth swipe animations and transitions between sections as before, but adjust to suit the light theme without dark overlays.

Final goal: The same workout section I approved in the dark theme version, but light-themed and fully functional without losing any of the working features.
