Please implement Stage 4 of the Thryvin’ app functionality. This stage focuses on adding smart reminders, AI-powered progress tracking, and motivational streak features. Follow the design and color system already in use across the app (purple/pink gradient, slick UI, rounded elements).

1️⃣ SMART NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEM
Set up a notifications system to send the following smart reminders:

⏰ “It’s 30 mins before your scheduled workout — ready to go?”

💧 “You haven’t logged water today.”

🍽️ “Time to log your next meal?”

💤 “Rest day tomorrow. Want a recovery suggestion?”

Allow user to customize notification preferences in their profile/settings (toggle on/off per reminder type)

Use localStorage or a lightweight backend solution to persist preferences

2️⃣ AI PROGRESS TRACKING + ADAPTATION
When users complete workouts, allow them to rate difficulty or give feedback:

“Too easy” → AI increases reps/weight slightly next time

“Too hard” → AI lowers difficulty or adds recovery

“Perfect” → AI continues progression

Track progress over time:

Reps completed

Weights lifted (if available)

Streaks hit

Store this data in a structured user progress object (userProgress) and use it to adapt the next generated workout

3️⃣ STREAKS + MOTIVATIONAL BOOSTERS
Implement a streak system:

If the user trains consecutive days (e.g. 3 in a row), show motivational message: “🔥 3-day streak, let’s go!”

Missed workout = streak reset

Display the streak count on the homepage and/or calendar

Add popups/toasts with motivational boosts:

“You’ve hit your weekly target — amazing!”

“Almost at your 5-day streak badge!”

🔧 DEV NOTES:
Make sure all UI matches the Thryvin’ design language

Keep code modular (NotificationManager, ProgressTracker, StreakManager)

Use dummy data where real sensors or backend aren’t available yet

Voice and text input should both be supported for logging progress or giving feedback

✅ This stage helps make the app feel alive, adaptive, and encouraging — like a real AI fitness coach would.
