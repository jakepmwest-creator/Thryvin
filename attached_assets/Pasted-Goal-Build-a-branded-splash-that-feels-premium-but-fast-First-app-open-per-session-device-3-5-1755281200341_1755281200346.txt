Goal: Build a branded splash that feels premium but fast:

First app open (per session/device): ~3.5s “cinematic” version.

After that: ~1.5s quick reveal.

Tech

HTML/CSS/JS with GSAP (no other heavy libs). Use SVG logo if possible for crisp masks; fall back to PNG.

Assets

assets/thryvin-logo.svg (preferred) or assets/thryvin-logo.png

Brand gradient: purple → pink linear-gradient(135deg,#7A3CF3 0%, #FF4FD8 100%)

Logic (pseudo)

If sessionStorage.getItem('splashSeen') !== '1' → play Full; then set flag.

Else → play Quick.

FULL animation (first launch, ~3.5s total)

0–0.9s – Background shows subtle brand gradient. Add a radial brighten wipe from center (SVG mask or CSS radial‑gradient animation) to create a quick “reveal” moment.

0.9–2.2s – Logo fill effect: animate a gradient sweep/drip inside the logo using SVG mask or clipPath (2–3 elegant strands, not cartoony). End with logo fully filled in brand gradient.

2.2–3.0s – Settle motion: scale 1 → 1.06 → 1 (soft elastic), slight glow.

3.0–3.5s – Fade out splash container to reveal app; remove listeners.

Constraints

60fps target on mobile; if timeline lags, skip to step 3 (logo settle) and finish on time.

Entire sequence must not exceed 3.5s.

QUICK animation (subsequent opens, ~1.5s total)

0–0.9s – Logo slides in from left (x: -40px → 0) with power3.out.

0.9–1.2s – Subtle bounce (scale 1 → 1.06 → 1).

1.2–1.5s – Fade out splash to app.

Integration

Splash is a full‑screen absolutely positioned container that covers the app and then removes itself.

Expose window.splash.done() when the fade completes; main app can await it or time out at 4s safety cap.

Set sessionStorage.setItem('splashSeen','1') after FULL plays.

Accessibility & Perf

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: if true, skip to QUICK (fade logo in for 400ms, then out).

Keep assets lightweight; inline small SVGs; preload the logo.

Ensure text/icon contrast is AAA over the gradient if any text is shown (ideally logo only).

Acceptance

First open = full 3.5s, then flag set.

Subsequent opens in same session/device = quick 1.5s.

No jank, no layout shift, responsive center alignment.

Works in iOS/Android webviews and desktop preview.
