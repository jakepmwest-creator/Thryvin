"Please refine my Thryvin’ fitness app by integrating the following two major improvements:

1️⃣ AI Workout Engine That Actually Uses the User's Profile
The app already gathers custom user input through onboarding questions (like fitness goals, preferred training time, equipment, experience level, etc.).

Now I need the AI to actually use those answers when generating workouts. Specifically:

💡 Workout Generation Logic
Make sure the AI-generated workouts are different for each training type.

e.g. ‘Upper Body’ day = push-ups, rows, overhead presses

‘HIIT’ = high-intensity bodyweight or cardio drills (like jumping jacks, mountain climbers, burpees)

Use the data from userProfile to shape workout difficulty and structure:

A beginner should get simpler, shorter workouts

Advanced users get more volume and complex exercises

If someone has specified limited time (e.g. 30 mins), cap the workout accordingly

If the user said “no equipment,” only include bodyweight exercises

Make the workout generator dynamic — pull from an exerciseLibrary array or database with tags like:

muscleGroup, equipment, difficulty, style (e.g. HIIT, strength)

🧠 Example:
cpp
Copy
Edit
const userProfile = {
  goal: "fat loss",
  timePreference: "morning",
  equipment: ["bodyweight"],
  experience: "beginner",
  trainingDays: ["Mon", "Wed", "Fri"]
}
A Monday HIIT workout for this user should include 4–5 cardio-based bodyweight exercises for 30 mins max

Each day should be different. Do not repeat the same workouts unless intended

2️⃣ Monthly Calendar – Samsung Galaxy Style
I want the calendar (weekly/monthly view) to be completely cleaned up and styled like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra calendar UI.

🗓️ Calendar UX/UI Requirements
Clean, minimal, modern layout

Rounded squares for each date

Smooth hover/tap animations

Add spacing/padding between days

Use system colors (Thryvin’s pink/purple gradient for current day, faded grey for past days, soft highlight for future planned days)

Add ✅ checkmark icons for completed workout days

Make each date fully interactive:

Tap to open a modal with:

That day's workout summary

Option to re-generate or edit

Button to mark as complete

Monthly view must be responsive and easy to scroll

Optional: Add an icon key (🟣 = active day, ✅ = complete, 🟠 = missed)
