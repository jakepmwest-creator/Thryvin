Update the existing Workout page of the Thryvin’ fitness app to make it more personal, adaptive, and user-friendly for real-life schedules. The app already has AI integration and has collected the user's goals, training frequency, equipment, and experience. Now the goal is to fine-tune their first week of workouts, using more detailed real-life info and giving them a smart, editable plan to follow.

🔑 1. Personal Schedule Kickstart (Smart Week 1 Builder):
When a user enters the Workout page for the first time after onboarding, show a friendly message or modal like:

“Let’s build your perfect week 💡”

Ask more real-world questions to refine their first 7-day plan:

“What actual days are you free to train this week?” (checkboxes for Mon–Sun)

“What time of day works best for you on those days?”

“Do you want short or long sessions this week?”

“Do you want to focus more on strength, cardio, recovery, or mix it up?”

After submission, generate a Week 1 workout plan that respects their schedule

Clearly show this is just for Week 1 and can be adjusted

🗓️ 2. Weekly + Monthly Schedule View (Editable & Dynamic):
Replace the current static schedule with an editable calendar layout

Weekly View:

Show scrollable day cards (Mon–Sun) with planned workout info

Each card can be tapped to:

View full workout

Edit the day/time

Swap workout or regenerate via AI

Mark complete ✅

Monthly View:

Toggle to view a full calendar (month view)

Let users add personal events (travel, work, rest days)

AI will adapt the schedule around those events

Example: “You’re away on Friday? I’ve moved your leg day to Thursday.”

💬 3. Coach Chat Integration (Remove Standalone Generator)
The “Generate Custom Workout” button should be removed

Instead, users interact with the AI Coach through the existing chat bubble

Add suggested prompts above the chat input (e.g. “Need a quick 20-min session?”)

When user types or speaks to the AI Coach (via mic input), it can:

Modify the schedule

Create a one-off custom workout

Recommend alternatives for today's workout

🔄 4. AI Learning & Feedback
Track what days the user actually trains

If they skip certain days, move things or adjust future plans

Update the userPreferences or userHistory with their actual behavior

Optionally show smart nudges:

“Noticed you prefer evening workouts — should I move next week’s plan later?”

💅 Style / UX
Follow the Thryvin’ modern theme and color palette

Make the weekly cards colorful, with animated status (e.g. flashing “Today”, dimmed “Rest”)

Friendly text, emoji-enhanced UI (💪📅🧠🔥)

Animated schedule transitions, hover effects, and onboarding pop-ups

🛠️ Tech
HTML/CSS/JS (or React if used in project)

Use or update existing user data

Mobile-friendly and modular”
