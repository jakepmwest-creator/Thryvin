Goal: Redesign the Overview screen of my Nutrition hub in React + Tailwind (light-first). Keep the existing content, remove the calendar/date line, make the top area functional (4 clickable sections), make Today’s Meals clean and tappable, and make the Nutrition Overview actually compute and update. Hide scrollbars while keeping scroll.

Keep the same sections/content order:

Top area (no date).

Section switcher: Overview · Meal Plan · Shopping · Learn (nice pill tabs, clickable).

Today’s Meals (split visually: “Picked by you” & “Picked by AI”).

Nutrition Overview (daily breakdown of what I had).

Recent favourites (if present) stays as a horizontal strip.

Visual system (light-first)

Page: bg-slate-50

Cards: bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl shadow-xs

Headings: text-slate-900, body: text-slate-700, muted: text-slate-500

Primary accent: indigo (underline, active chips, buttons)

Spacing: p-4 md:p-5 on cards; section gaps gap-6

Hide scrollbars, keep scroll:

.scroll-hidden { -ms-overflow-style: none; scrollbar-width: none; }
.scroll-hidden::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }

Components to build

NutritionOverviewPage (page shell)

Top bar (no date). Right side can have a subtle icon button (⋯) if needed.

SegmentedTabs (sticky): Overview · Meal Plan · Shopping · Learn

Pills, rounded-full; active pill in indigo; animated underline (Framer Motion).

Keyboard accessible (role="tablist", role="tab", aria-selected).

Main vertical content: class="overflow-y-auto scroll-hidden"

TodaysMeals

Header row: “Today’s meals” + + Quick add (text button in text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-700).

Two sub-sections (only if you have both sources; otherwise list straight):

“Picked by you” (small label chip)

“Picked by AI” (small label chip)

MealCard design:

Card: bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-4 md:p-5 shadow-xs hover:shadow-sm transition

Left status marker: hollow circle → filled check when consumed.

Title, kcal, and macro chips (bg-slate-100 text-slate-600 text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded-full).

Tap toggles consumed (optimistic) and updates totals.

Long-press opens action sheet: Edit • Replace • Duplicate • Details.

(Optional) Swipe right = eaten, left = not eaten if a swipe lib is available.

Empty state: suggestion card “Based on your plan: add Oats & Yogurt?” with Add button.

NutritionOverviewBreakdown (today)

Section title: “Nutrition overview (today)”.

Progress bars (light theme friendly) for Protein / Carbs / Fat:

Each row: label on left; on right show Consumed / Target / Remaining (monospace/tabular).

Clicking a macro row expands to list contributing meals (small list of meal names + grams).

Optional micro-metrics (chips): Fibre, Sugar, Sodium.

RecentFavourites (if you show it on Overview)

Horizontal carousel; hidden scrollbar; small cards with name + kcal.

Tap = quick-add; show undo snackbar (“Added Greek Yogurt · Undo”).

State & logic (wire up minimal working)
type MealItem = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  kcal: number;
  protein: number;
  carbs: number;
  fat: number;
  source?: "user" | "ai";
  time?: "breakfast" | "lunch" | "dinner" | "snack";
  consumed: boolean;
};

type Targets = { kcal:number; protein:number; carbs:number; fat:number };
type Totals  = { kcal:number; protein:number; carbs:number; fat:number };

state = {
  activeTab: "overview" as const, // tabs are clickable, others can be placeholders for now
  todaysMeals: MealItem[],        // seed 4–6 items; mix of source: "user" and "ai"
  targets: { kcal: 2300, protein: 180, carbs: 250, fat: 70 },
  totals: { kcal: 0, protein: 0, carbs: 0, fat: 0 }
};


Functions

toggleConsumed(id) → flip consumed; then recalcTotals().

recalcTotals() → sum only consumed meals into totals; re-render breakdown.

navigate(tab) → set active tab; animate underline.

quickAdd(meal) → push to todaysMeals; optimistic UI + undo snackbar.

Motion & feedback

Tabs underline: Framer Motion spring; active pill gets subtle glow.

Card press: scale to 0.98 for 150–200ms.

Toggle consumed: check fills + numbers in Breakdown count up/down (~150ms).

When tapping the mini snapshot (if you keep one), smooth scroll to Breakdown and briefly highlight it.

Accessibility

Tabs: correct roles/aria; left/right arrows switch; Enter/Space activates.

MealCard acts as a button; Enter/Space toggles consumed.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Light theme contrast meets WCAG AA.

Definition of done

No date/calendar line at the top.

Segmented tabs look clean (pills) and are clickable (Overview · Meal Plan · Shopping · Learn).

Today’s Meals looks polished; meals are tappable to mark eaten/not eaten; totals update instantly.

Nutrition Overview shows Protein/Carbs/Fat with Consumed / Target / Remaining and expands to show contributors.

Vertical scrollbar is hidden but scrolling works smoothly across Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge.

Uses your light-first visuals everywhere.
