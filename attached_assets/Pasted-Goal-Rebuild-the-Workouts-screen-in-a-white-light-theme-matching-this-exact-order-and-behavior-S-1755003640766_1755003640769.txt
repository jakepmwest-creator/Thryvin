Goal: Rebuild the Workouts screen in a white/light theme, matching this exact order and behavior:

Session Banner (top) with meta + Start Workout CTA

Weekly Calendar (clean, edge‑to‑edge) — tapping a day shows the correct Day Detail

Explore Fitness grid (3 rows × 2 columns), gradient cards

Keep all existing logic working (day detail, swap exercise, videos, logging, completion). Do not change routes.

0) Shell
Top app bar: Thryvin logo (left), settings (right → /profile/settings)

Bottom nav: Home, Workouts*, Nutrition, Social, Profile

Vertical scroll only

1) Session Banner (top)
Light theme, airy white card with soft shadow and rounded corners (20dp)

Left stack:

Title: “Today’s Workout”

Sub: workout name (e.g., Upper Body Push) + duration (e.g., 45 min)

Micro‑meta chips (optional): focus (e.g., Chest/Triceps), equipment

Right: prominent Start Workout pill button → /workouts/player?date=today

Entire banner tap → /workouts?date=today

No onboarding here; if profile.hasPlan === true, never show the questionnaire

2) Weekly Calendar (clean, edge‑to‑edge)
Default to Week view (7‑day strip); optional Month toggle is allowed but Week is default

Style: light/white background, large taps, no heavy borders; use a faint divider only

States:

Today: brand ring highlight

Past: dim labels

Completed: small ✅ badge

Selected: pill highlight

Behavior: Tapping any date updates Day Detail (below) without page reload and preserves scroll

Deep links supported: /workouts?date=YYYY-MM-DD

(Note: If Month view exists, keep it clean, borderless, and match selection states.)

3) Day Detail (below calendar)
Header: workout title, date, duration

Sections as accordions: Warm‑up, Main, Recovery

Each row: tiny thumbnail/icon, name, sets×reps/time, rest

Actions: Info (video modal), Swap (AI alternatives), Notes

Button: Start workout (same route as banner) → /workouts/player?date=YYYY-MM-DD

Preserve existing working behavior:

Swapping exercises persists to the plan for that date (not global template)

Video modals use real clips

Notes save inline

4) Explore Fitness (3×2 gradient grid)
Title: Explore fitness

Grid: 3 rows × 2 columns (6 cards total), equal size, rounded 20dp, gradient backgrounds (brand‑tinted)

Examples:

Strength → /workouts/explore?tag=strength

Calisthenics → /workouts/explore?tag=calisthenics

HIIT → /workouts/explore?tag=hiit

Mobility/Yoga → /workouts/explore?tag=mobility

Core → /workouts/explore?tag=core

Conditioning → /workouts/explore?tag=conditioning

Each card: icon, title; subtle hover/tap lift; no long text

5) Player flow (keep current logic intact)
/workouts/player?date=YYYY-MM-DD

Pre‑start: section tabs or swipe between Warm‑up / Main / Recovery

Exercise view: video, Log set (idempotent—one log per set), Next/Back, Skip, Notes with voice → text shown before save

Finish:

Block completion for future days (“preview only” message)

Summary for today/past: duration, sets, notes; Save & return marks ✅ on calendar

6) Theme (Light) tokens
Page background: #FFFFFF

Card background: #FFFFFF; shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.06) 0 8px 24px

Text: primary #0B0F1A, secondary #6B7280

Brand gradient (accents/buttons/cards): linear-gradient(135deg,#7A3CF3 0%,#FF4FD8 100%)

Calendar selected pill: rgba(122,60,243,0.12) with brand text

Corner radius: 20dp (cards), 12–14dp (rows, pills)

7) Must‑keep functionality
Calendar tap → shows Day Detail for that date (no reload)

Start Workout works from banner & day detail; routes to player for that date

Swap actually replaces the exercise and persists

Log set can’t double‑save

Completed day shows ✅ on calendar and read‑only summary on reopen

No onboarding loop if hasPlan === true

8) QA checklist
Deep link ?date= selects the correct day and shows matching details

Week strip scrolls horizontally if needed; page stays vertical

Explore cards route to correct tags

Returning from player preserves selected day and week view

No broken/legacy “Kai” links
