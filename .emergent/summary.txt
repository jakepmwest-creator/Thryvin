The previous AI engineer began by understanding the initial request to create an empty project. This quickly evolved into cloning an existing GitHub repository for a Thryvin native app. The core work revolved around stabilizing a sophisticated monorepo (FastAPI/Express backend, PostgreSQL, React Native/Expo frontend). Key achievements include configuring environment variables, establishing robust backend API connectivity, fixing the React Native app's API client (including base URL and endpoint versioning), converting a mock authentication store to real API calls, and initiating fixes for the AI workout generation system. The AI dynamically loaded exercises from the database, seeded a comprehensive exercise library, and addressed exercise name normalization issues for AI-generated workouts. A major effort was dedicated to resolving GitHub security blocks by purging secrets from history and configuring . Most recently, the AI completed a significant UI redesign for the native app, implementing a clean, gradient-accented aesthetic across core screens (Home, Workouts, Stats, Awards, Profile). The process highlights iterative development, focused troubleshooting, and close adherence to evolving user requirements.

<product_requirements>
The Thryvin application is envisioned as an intelligent, personalized fitness ecosystem that evolves with the user. It combines AI-driven workout generation, smart habit tracking, and real-time progress feedback into a gamified experience. Users can generate custom AI workouts, access a Nutrition Hub, earn awards, and engage with an AI Coach. The AI leverages onboarding data (goals, experience, equipment, personality, injuries) and adapts based on progress, preferences, and feedback. It balances movement patterns, considers recovery, scales intensity, and offers selectable coaching personalities. Future plans include social features and integration with health metrics. Currently, the app has a functional onboarding, login/auth, tab-based layout, dark mode, and a consistent UI. The immediate focus has been on stabilizing the existing codebase, connecting frontend to backend, fixing authentication, and getting AI workout generation to function correctly, followed by a complete UI redesign for the native app.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed a significant UI redesign of the Thryvin native application. This involved:
-   Updating  for global stack navigation.
-   Updating  to define a new bottom tab navigation bar with Home, Workouts, Stats, Awards, and Profile tabs, adhering to the specified clean, bright, minimal aesthetic with purple-blue gradient accents and rounded corners.
-   Creating  for the Home screen, featuring a welcome message, a gradient progress ring placeholder, and three action buttons (Start Workout, View Stats, Check Nutrition).
-   Updating the individual screen files: , , , and , to align with the new design language, including usage of  and .
-   Removing old, unused screen files (, ).
This UI redesign was immediately preceded by a lengthy process of resolving GitHub push security issues, where environment variables and temporary scripts containing secrets were purged from git history and  rules were meticulously updated. The current state is a newly redesigned native app UI, with a backend that has been stabilized and has working authentication and AI workout generation endpoints.
